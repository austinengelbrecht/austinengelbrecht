# Hey, I'm Austin

Hi, my name is Austin! While getting my Information Science degree, I found my passion for building websites and working in front-end code. I am a self-motivated developer striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Whether it's through online courses, attending conferences, or working on personal projects, I am constantly striving to learn and grow as a web developer.
